Message Opener-- Developed by Yash Sanghavi

Hey, this was my first completely SOLO project. Hope you like it!

Please Note that this is ONLY FOR MACS.

To use this application, you will need to install CocoaDialog and place it into your Applications folder. Without this, the program will NOT run.

Thanks,
Yash
